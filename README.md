Hi, I'm Elliot! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Toronto. With a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and problem-solving, I am passionate about using statistical and mathematical techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. I am eager to bring my analytical skills and mathematical rigor to a role in data analysis or data science.

Throughout my studies, I have developed the ability to work with complex datasets and gained a solid grounding in statistical modeling, probability theory, and data analysis. My coursework and projects have equipped me with hands-on experience in data management, statistical computing, and visualization skills, which I look forward to applying in a professional environment.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new tools and techniques in data science and statistics. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills, whether through online courses, personal projects, or collaborative initiatives. I find great satisfaction in uncovering patterns and insights in data and am driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems using quantitative methods.

This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills and tracking my progress in data analysis, statistics, and related areas.
