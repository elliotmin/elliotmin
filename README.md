Hi, I'm Elliot! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Toronto. With a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and problem-solving, I am passionate about using statistical and mathematical techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. I am eager to bring my analytical skills and mathematical rigor to a role in data analysis or data science.

This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills and tracking my progress in data analysis, statistics, and related areas.
