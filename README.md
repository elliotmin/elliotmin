Hello, I’m Elliot Min! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. Working with data and finding patterns has always been something that interested me since I was young, specifically transforming raw data into structured, high-quality datasets through data cleaning and wrangling, primarily using R and Python. My goal is to progress my skills in using exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends using visualization tools like ggplot2 matplotlib. This github is will serve as a way to keep a repository of all the projects I work on.
